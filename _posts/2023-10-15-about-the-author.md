Hello traveler! I'm @rwxayhee. Iâ€™m currently a chemistry graduate student at tOSU. I was born and raised in [Hangzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou) from the East China. My hobbies are fictions, travel, gaming, medicinal chemistry and coding. 

When I was a kid I used to love writing for fun, but never start a professional blog for myself (this really isn't one either). I created the site to post some notes that I wish to share with links & markdowns (who doesn't like copying codes). 

Should you have any questions/comments/suggestions, feel free to reach out by my institute email: he.1768@osu.edu
